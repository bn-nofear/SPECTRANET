The "code" directory contains the code for all comparative models, with "result analysis.py" specifically designated for result analysis.

The "data" directory encompasses all of our data resources. Notably, "date_serie.csv" encompasses date-related data, while "stock_info.csv" houses various stock-related information such as stock codes, industries, market capitalization, and others. Files "hs300close1.h5" and "hs300close2.h5" represent data on the 1-minute closing prices of the CSI 300 Index (HS300) throughout a trading day. Due to file size limitations, these data were divided into two files. Similarly, "hs300volume1.h5" and "hs300volume2.h5" contain 1-minute trading volume data of the HS300 Index and are pivotal for our analysis. Additionally, "hs300historyvolume.h5" captures historical 1-minute trading volume data of the HS300 Index, which serves as a basis for constructing historical information in the SPECTRANET model.
